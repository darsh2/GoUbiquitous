        If the data present in the WatchFace is the same as today's weather data, do not

        Commenting out this logic because -
        Say this app is run and is connected to a square wear watch face. The current weather data is saved
        in phone's SharedPreference and since this is the first launch, previous data is not equal to current
        data and it is sent to the wear device. The weather data is shown on the square wear watch face.

        Now let's say we connect to a round wear watch face. If the app on the device is not freshly installed
        or if the app data is not cleared and if the current data is same as before, then the square wear device
        will not get the weather data. So even on first launch of app on the wear device, it will not show any
        data.

        Have to find a better way to solve this. Hence for simplicity, currently do not check if previous data
        equals current data.
